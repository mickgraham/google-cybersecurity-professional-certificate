# Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security

## Overview

This course covers network architecture, operations, intrusion tactics, common types of network vulnerabilities and attacks, and methods for securing networks. The course also introduces common network protocols, firewalls, virtual private networks (VPNs), and system hardening practices.

### Module 1: Network Architecture

This module introduces network security and explains how it relates to ongoing security threats and vulnerabilities. It covers network architecture and mechanisms used to secure a network.

### Module 2: Network Operations

This module explores network protocols and the ways in which network communication can introduce vulnerabilities. It also covers common security measures, such as firewalls, that help ensure safe and reliable network operations.

### Module 3: Secure Against Network Intrusions

This module provides an understanding of the types of network attacks and the techniques used to secure compromised network systems and devices. It examines the methods malicious actors use to exploit vulnerabilities in network infrastructure and how cybersecurity professionals identify and close potential loopholes.

### Module 4: Security Hardening

This module familiarizes participants with network hardening practices that strengthen network systems. It covers how security hardening defends against malicious actors and intrusion methods, as well as how these practices address the unique security challenges posed by cloud infrastructures.
