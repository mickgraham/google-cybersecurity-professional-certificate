## Scenario

You've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.

A risk register is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.

Your supervisor asks you to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, you will first determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then, you will determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, you will calculate a score for the severity of that risk. You will then compare scores across all risks so your team can determine how to prioritise their attention for each risk.

## Score risks based on their likelihood and severity

| Risk(s)                    | Description                                                   | Likelihood | Severity | Priority |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|----------|
| Business email compromise  | An employee is tricked into sharing confidential information. | 3          | 2        | 6        |
| Compromised user database  | Customer data is poorly encrypted.                            | 2          | 2        | 4        |
| Financial records leak     | A database server of backed-up data is publicly accessible.   | 2          | 2        | 4        |
| Theft                      | The bank's safe is left unlocked.                             | 1          | 3        | 3        |
| Supply chain disruption    | Delivery delays due to natural disasters.                     | 1          | 1        | 1        |

**Notes:** Possible security events include:

* Social engineering attacks on employees
* Unauthorised access to bank data due to poor data access controls
* Theft, most likely from inside sources
* Unexpected events due to natural disasters
