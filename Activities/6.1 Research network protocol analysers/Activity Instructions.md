# Activity: Research network protocol analysers

*This activity is based on a fictional scenario.*

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you'll focus on the two network protocol analysers: Wireshark and tcpdump. Your goal is to gain a basic understanding of the Wireshark and tcpdump, how they work, and what their features are.

As you've learned, a network protocol analyser (packet sniffer) is a tool designed to capture and analyse data traffic within a network. Network protocol analysers help security analysts examine and understand the network traffic flows.

## Part 1 - Access the resources

### Step 1: Access the template

* [Diagram template](./diagram-template.pptx) (diagram-template.pptx)

### Step 2: Conduct online research

To begin, conduct online research to learn more about tcpdump and Wireshark. You can begin by using the official Wireshark documentation and tcpdump documentation:

* [tcpdump - Resources and documentation](https://www.tcpdump.org/index.html#documentation)
* [Wireshark - Official user guide](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html/)

You can also perform an internet search to find resources that explain how these tools work. Try searching for information using these terms:

* Wireshark features and functionalities
* tcpdump features and functionalities
* comparison between tcpdump and Wireshark

Be sure to critically evaluate the search results and select reliable and authoritative sources such as official documentation, reputable cybersecurity websites, or technical forums that provide accurate and factual information about the tools.

Explore these resources to gather information on tcpdump and Wireshark and focus on understanding the different features and functionalities that each tool has.

Consider these questions to help you compare the two tools:

* What software or equipment is required to access and use the tool? Is the tool open-source or proprietary?
* What type of user interface or layout does the tool use?
* How do security analysts typically use the tool? What are the recommended usage scenarios for each tool?
* How does the tool handle capturing, analysing, and filtering network traffic?
* Are there any limitations or considerations for using this tool?

### Step 3: Fill in the diagram

After you've completed your research on Wireshark and tcpdump, fill out the template and include at least two features for each tool. These could be related to the tool's capabilities, the type of analysis they perform, contrasting features, user interfaces, usage scenarios, and any other notable distinctions. Then, include three similarities between tcpdump and Wireshark.
