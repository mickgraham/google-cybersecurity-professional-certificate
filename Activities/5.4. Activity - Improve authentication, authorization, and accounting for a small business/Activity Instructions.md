# Activity: Improve authentication, authorization, and accounting for a small business

*This activity is based on a fictional scenario.*

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will assess the access controls used by a business. You'll analyze their current process, identify issues, and make recommendations to improve their security practices.

Previously, you learned that access controls are security controls that manage access, authorization, and accountability of information. Authentication controls are used to verify who someone is, whereas authorization controls are used to grant a user permissions and set limits on the things they're allowed to do. When done well, access controls are the key to decreasing the likelihood of a security risk.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access the template

* [Access control worksheet](./access-control-worksheet.docx) (access-control-worksheet.docx)

### Step 2: Access supporting materials

* [Accounting exercise](./accounting-exercise.xlsx) (accounting-exercise.xlsx)

### Step 3: Review the event log of this payroll incident

Event logs contain information related to the operation and usage of a system. They can be utilised to identify suspicious activity, detect vulnerabilities, and track users.

Find the **Event log** tab of the Accounting exercise spreadsheet. Carefully review the event log of this incident to start your investigation. Notice the Event Type, Date, Time, and IP Address of the user in the log details.

Make **1-2 notes** of information that you learned about the user from reviewing the Event log details. Add your notes to the **Notes** column of the access control worksheet.

### Step 4: Identify access control issues that led to the incident

Log details tell you a lot about a specific moment in time. You can find other useful details about an event by cross referencing that information with other sources.

This business has a range of different employees. They all currently manage company resources using a shared cloud drive.

Find the **Employee directory** tab of the Accounting exercise spreadsheet. Compare the information found in the Employee directory tab with the information in the Event log tab. Notice any similarities between the details in the Event log and the details in the Employee directory.

Then, list **1-2 issues** that you discover with how the business handles employee access in the **Issues** column of the Access control worksheet.

### Step 5: Recommend mitigations that can prevent a future breach

You've completed your accounting of the strange payment and discovered flaws with how the business handles their information.

Find the **Recommendation(s)** column of the Access control worksheet. Make **at least 2** recommendations of mitigations the business can implement to prevent incidents like this in the future.

For example, one recommendation might be to have procedures in place to revoke access to files when an employee is no longer with the company.
