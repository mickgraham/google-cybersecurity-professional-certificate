# Activity: Classify the assets connected to a home network

*This activity is based on a fictional scenario.*

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will classify assets connected to a home office network.

Asset management is a critical part of every organization's security plan. Remember that asset management is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. Effective asset management starts with creating an asset inventory, or a catalog of assets that need to be protected. Then, it involves classifying assets based on their level of importance and sensitivity to risk.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access the template

Link to template:
* [Home asset inventory](./home-asset-inventory.xlsx) (home-asset-inventory.xlsx)

### Step 2: Identify assets

In the asset inventory spreadsheet, find the **Asset** column header. Consider the devices that may be connected to the home network. Examine devices in the scenario graphic to help you brainstorm.

Choose three devices that are not already listed in the spreadsheet and add them to the empty rows in the Asset column.

Note: A few devices, like a network router, desktop, and a guest smartphone have already been added for your reference.

### Step 3: Fill in the characteristics of each asset

List important characteristics, including Network access, Owner, and Location for each asset that you've identified.

Here's an explanation of each characteristic:

* **Network access** describes how often the device is connected to the network.
* **Owner** describes the person responsible for the device.
* **Location** describes where the device is located in relation to the router.

### Step 4: Evaluate the access of network devices

Review the information that you've listed in the Network access, Owner, and Location columns.

In the **Notes** column, record 1 or 2 details or characteristics of each device. Do this by asking yourself questions about each:

* What kind of information is stored on the device?
* How does it connect to the network?
* Is the owner careful about securing it?

For example, the desktop computer contains sensitive information, like photos, that only the owner should have access to. In contrast, the network router uses one frequency for smart home devices and another for all other devices.

Note: Keep in mind that there might be some variation within each category. Try to identify details that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information that's connected to the network.

### Step 5: Classify the sensitivity of network devices

It's time to classify assets based on the information you've collected. Do this by thinking about how an asset could impact your business if its security was compromised:

* What types of information would be disclosed or stolen?
* Could an attacker alter information on the device?
* What would happen to the business if this information were destroyed?

For example, the network router is classified as confidential because the owner has granted limited access to the device to specific users.

Find the **Sensitivity** column in the asset inventory. Type one of the four levels of sensitivity you previously learned about.

Note: You can use the Categories table as a guide for choosing an appropriate classification.
