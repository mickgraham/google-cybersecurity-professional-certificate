## Scenario

One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network and each is a potential entry point to other assets.

An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.

A home office that includes a desktop computer, printer, router, webcam, speakers, headphones, and external hard drive.

You're operating a small business from your home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.

To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as:

* Desktop or laptop computers
* Smartphones
* Smart home devices
* Game consoles
* Storage devices or servers
* Video streaming devices

Then, you'll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, you will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.

## Classify the assets connected to a home network

### Identify assets

* Laptop computer
* Game console
* Smart device (e.g. fridge)

### Fill in the characteristics of each asset

* Laptop
  * Network access: Occasional
  * Owner: Homeowner
  * Location: On and Off-premises
* Game console
  * Network access: Occasional
  * Owner: Homeowner
  * Location: On-premises
* Smart device (e.g. fridge)
  * Network access: Occasional
  * Owner: Homeowner
  * Location: On-premises

### Evaluate the access of network devices

What kind of information is stored on the device?

* Laptop
  * Private information, like emails and photos
* Game console
  * Public information like installed games, private information like user details
* Smart device (e.g. fridge)
  * Displays advertisements

How does it connect to the network?

* Laptop
  * Connects to home network
* Game console
  * Connects to home network
* Smart device (e.g. fridge)
  * Connects to home network

Is the owner careful about securing it?

* Laptop
  * Yes, has login password
* Game console
  * No, login details are saved on device
* Smart device (e.g. fridge)
  * No

### Classify the sensitivity of network devices

* Laptop
  * Restricted
* Game console
  * Internal-only
* Smart device (e.g. fridge)
  * Internal-only

### Summary

| | Asset | Network access | Owner | Location | Notes | Sensitivity |
