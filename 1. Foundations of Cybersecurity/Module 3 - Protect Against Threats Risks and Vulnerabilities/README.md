# Module 3 - Protect Against Threats Risks and Vulnerabilities

## Overview

This module covers how organizations protect themselves from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

### Security Frameworks and Controls

* Security frameworks and controls are important for organizing security efforts and making informed decisions.
* Continuous improvements to policies and procedures are necessary in the evolving field of security.
* The Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad is a foundational model in information security that guides an organization's policies and efforts to protect information assets.

### Ethics in Cybersecurity

* Ethics in cybersecurity refers to the moral principles that guide professional conduct and the responsible use of security technologies.
* It extends beyond legal requirements, emphasizing sound judgment in complex situations.
* Its core aim is to balance security needs with individual rights and broader societal values.

## How controls, frameworks, and compliance are related

The confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.

CIA are the three foundational principles used by cybersecurity professionals to establish appropriate controls that mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. So they are used alongside frameworks to ensure that security goals and processes are implemented correctly and that organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements.

Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. They have four core components:

* Identifying and documenting security goals
* Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
* Implementing strong security processes
* Monitoring and communicating results

## Ethical concepts that guide cybersecurity decisions

Security ethics are guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional. Being ethical requires that security professionals remain unbiased and maintain the security and confidentiality of private data.

### Counterattacks

Counterattacks are actions taken against threat actors. They can lead to serious consequences, including escalation of attacks.

The only individuals in the U.S. who are allowed to counterattack are approved employees of the federal government or military personnel.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ), which updates its guidance regularly, states that a person or group can counterattack if:

* The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first.
* The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.
* The counterattack does not escalate the situation.
* The counterattack effects can be reversed.

Organizations typically do not counterattack because the above scenarios and parameters are hard to measure. There is a lot of uncertainty dictating what is and is not lawful, and at times negative outcomes are very difficult to control. Counterattack actions generally lead to a worse outcome, especially when you are not an experienced professional in the field.

### Ethical principles and methodologies

Because counterattacks are generally disapproved of or illegal, the security realm has created frameworks and controls - such as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad to address issues of confidentiality, privacy protections, and laws.

**Confidentiality** means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. Confidentiality as it relates to professional ethics means that there needs to be a high level of respect for privacy to safeguard private assets and data.

**Privacy protection** means safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use. Personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII) are types of personal data that can cause people harm if they are stolen. PII data is any information used to infer an individual's identity, like their name and phone number. SPII data is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines, including social security numbers and credit card numbers. To effectively safeguard PII and SPII data, security professionals hold an ethical obligation to secure private information, identify security vulnerabilities, manage organizational risks, and align security with business goals.

**Laws** are rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity. As a security professional, you will have an ethical obligation to protect your organization, its internal infrastructure, and the people involved with the organization. To do this:

* You must remain unbiased and conduct your work honestly, responsibly, and with the highest respect for the law.
* Be transparent and just, and rely on evidence.
* Ensure that you are consistently invested in the work you are doing, so you can appropriately and ethically address issues that arise.
* Stay informed and strive to advance your skills, so you can contribute to the betterment of the cyber landscape.
