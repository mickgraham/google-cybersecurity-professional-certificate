## Common attacks and their effectiveness

### Phishing

Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.

Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include; **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**, **Spear phishing**, **Whaling**, **Vishing**, **Smishing**.

### Malware

Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.

Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include; **Viruses**, **Worms**, **Ransomware**, **Spyware**.

### Social Engineering

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. It's the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible.

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include; **Social media phishing**, **Watering hole attack**, **USB baiting**, **Physical social engineering**.

### Social Engineering Principles

Social engineering is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people's data. Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it's also a risk.

Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include; **Authority**, **Intimidation**, **Consensus/Social proof**, **Scarcity**, **Familiarity**, **Trust**, **Urgency**.

## The 8 CISSP Security Domains

The eight CISSP security domains can help an organization and its security team fortify against and prepare for a data breach. Data breaches range from simple to complex and fall under one or more domains.

1. **Security and Risk Management:** Covers the identification, management, and protection of an organization's security posture through policies, standards, and procedures.
2. **Asset Security:** Focuses on the protection of information and assets, including data classification, data handling, and data retention.
3. **Security Architecture and Engineering:** Deals with the design and implementation of secure systems and architectures, including security models and cryptography.
4. **Communication and Network Security:** Focuses on the security of communication channels and networks, including network architecture, protocols, and security devices.
5. **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Covers the management of digital identities and access control, including authentication, authorization, and access provisioning.
6. **Security Assessment and Testing:** Involves the testing and auditing of security controls, including vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and security audits.
7. **Security Operations:** Focuses on the ongoing security operations, including incident response, disaster recovery, and the application of security controls.
8. **Software Development Security:** Deals with incorporating security practices into the software development lifecycle, including secure coding and security testing for applications.

### Attack Types

#### Social engineering attack

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

Social engineering attacks are related to the security and risk management domain.

#### Physical attack

A physical attack is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:
* Malicious USB cable
* Malicious flash drive
* Card cloning and skimming

Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain.

#### Password attack

A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks are:
* Brute force
* Rainbow table

#### Cryptographic attack

A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are:
* Birthday
* Collision
* Downgrade

Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain.

Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain.

#### Adversarial artificial intelligence

Adversarial artificial intelligence is a technique that manipulates artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently.

Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

#### Supply-chain attack

A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them.

Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

## Threat Actor Types

### Advanced persistent threats

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

* Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources
* Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents

### Insider threats

Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include:

* Sabotage
* Corruption
* Espionage
* Unauthorized data access or leaks

### Hacktivists

Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include:

* Demonstrations
* Propaganda
* Social change campaigns
* Fame

### Hacker types

A hacker is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

* **Authorized hackers** are also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.
* **Semi-authorized hackers** are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don't take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.
* **Unauthorized hackers** are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain.

**Note:** There are multiple hacker types that fall into one or more of these three categories.
