# Module 4 - Cybersecurity Tools and Programming Languages

## Overview

This module introduces essential tools and programming languages used in cybersecurity for efficient security monitoring and task automation.

* **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** These are crucial for collecting and analyzing security data from various sources.
* **Playbooks and Network Protocol Analyzers:** These tools assist in automating responses to security incidents and examining network traffic for anomalies.
* **Linux Operating System:** A fundamental platform for many cybersecurity operations.
* **SQL (Structured Query Language):** Highly useful for exploring and analyzing data from different sources to identify trends.
* **Python:** A versatile language often used for scripting and automating security tasks.

## Tools for protecting business operations

### Security information and event management (SIEM) tools

A SIEM tool is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. A log is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems. Depending on the amount of data you're working with, it could take hours or days to filter through log data on your own. SIEM tools reduce the amount of data an analyst must review by providing alerts for specific types of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. SIEM tools provide a series of dashboards that visually organize data into categories, allowing users to select the data they wish to analyze.

### Network protocol analyzers (packet sniffers)

A network protocol analyzer, also known as a packet sniffer, is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic in a network. This means that the tool keeps a record of all the data that a computer within an organization's network encounters.

### Playbooks

A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action, such as how to respond to a security incident. Organizations usually have multiple playbooks documenting processes and procedures for their teams to follow. Playbooks vary from one organization to the next, but they all have a similar purpose: To guide analysts through a series of steps to complete specific security-related tasks.

The first type of playbook you might consult is called the **chain of custody** playbook. Chain of custody is the process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle. As a security analyst involved in a forensic analysis, you will work with the computer data that was breached. You and the forensic team will also need to document who, what, where, and why you have the collected evidence. The evidence is your responsibility while it is in your possession. Evidence must be kept safe and tracked. Every time evidence is moved, it should be reported. This allows all parties involved to know exactly where the evidence is at all times.

The second playbook your team might use is called the **protecting and preserving evidence** playbook. Protecting and preserving evidence is the process of properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence. As a security analyst, understanding what fragile and volatile digital evidence is, along with why there is a procedure, is critical. As you follow this playbook, you will consult the order of volatility, which is a sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last. It prioritises volatile data, which is data that may be lost if the device in question powers off, regardless of the reason. While conducting an investigation, improper management of digital evidence can compromise and alter that evidence. When evidence is improperly managed during an investigation, it can no longer be used. For this reason, the first priority in any investigation is to properly preserve the data. You can preserve the data by making copies and conducting your investigation using those copies.
