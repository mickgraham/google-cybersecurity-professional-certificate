# Assets, Threats and Vulnerabilities

## Overview

Security is a collaborative effort involving diverse teams with a shared goal of protecting valuable assets through a combination of people, processes, and tools. The course covers asset security, proactive protection systems, common vulnerabilities, and threat modelling to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to safeguard important assets.

## Module 1: Introduction to asset security

This module introduces how organizations determine which assets to protect. It explains the connection between managing risk and classifying assets by examining the unique challenges of securing physical and digital assets. It also presents the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risk.

## Module 2: Protect organizational assets

This module focuses on security controls that protect organizational assets. It explores how privacy impacts asset security and outlines the role of encryption in maintaining the privacy of digital assets. It also examines how authentication and authorization systems verify a user's identity.

## Module 3: Vulnerabilities in systems

This module develops an understanding of the vulnerability management process. It reviews common vulnerabilities and promotes an attacker mindset by analysing how vulnerabilities can become threats to asset security when exploited.

## Module 4: Threats to asset security

This module examines common types of threats to digital asset security. It reviews the tools and techniques used by cyber-criminals to target assets. In addition, it introduces the threat modelling process and highlights methods security professionals use to stay ahead of security breaches.
