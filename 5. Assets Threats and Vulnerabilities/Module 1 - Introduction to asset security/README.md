## Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

These words tend to be used interchangeably in everyday life. But in security, they are used to describe very specific concepts when responding to and planning for security events.

* **Risk:** Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset
* **Threat:** Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets
* **Vulnerability:** A weakness that can be exploited by a threat

**Security plans:** are all about how an organization defines risk. However, this definition can vary widely by organization. As you may recall, a risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. Since organizations have particular assets that they value, they tend to differ in how they interpret and approach risk.

One way to interpret risk is to consider the potential effects that negative events can have on a business. Another way to present this idea is with the calculation `Likelihood x Impact = Risk`.

In general, we calculate risk in this field to help:

* Prevent costly and disruptive events
* Identify improvements that can be made to systems and processes
* Determine which risks can be tolerated
* Prioritise the critical assets that require attention

**Risk factors:** There are two broad risk factors that you'll be concerned with in the field:

* Threats
* Vulnerabilities

**Threats:** are circumstances or events that can negatively impact assets. There are many different types of threats. However, they are commonly categorised as two types: **intentional** and **unintentional**.

For example, an intentional threat might be a malicious hacker who gains access to sensitive information by targeting a misconfigured application. An unintentional threat might be an employee who holds the door open for an unknown person and grants them access to a restricted area. Either one can cause an event that must be responded to.

**Vulnerabilities:** are weaknesses that can be exploited by threats. There's a wide range of vulnerabilities, but they can be grouped into two categories: **technical** and **human**.

For example, a technical vulnerability can be misconfigured software that might give an unauthorised person access to important data. A human vulnerability can be a forgetful employee who loses their access card in a parking lot. Either one can lead to risk.

The risk of an asset being harmed or damaged depends greatly on whether a threat takes advantage of vulnerabilities.

## Asset Inventories

**Asset management:** is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. The idea behind this process is simple: you can only protect what you know you have.

Keeping assets safe requires a workable system that helps businesses operate smoothly. Setting these systems up requires having detailed knowledge of the assets in an environment. For example, a bank needs to have money available each day to serve its customers. Equipment, devices, and processes need to be in place to ensure that money is available and secure from unauthorised access.

Organizations protect a variety of different assets. Some examples might include:

* **Digital assets** such as customer data or financial records.
* **Information systems** that process data, like networks or software.
* **Physical assets** which can include facilities, equipment, or supplies.
* **Intangible assets** such as brand reputation or intellectual property.

**Asset classification:** helps organizations implement an effective risk management strategy. It also helps them prioritise security resources, reduce IT costs, and stay in compliance with legal regulations.

The most common classification scheme is: restricted, confidential, internal-only, and public.

* **Restricted** is the highest level. This category is reserved for incredibly sensitive assets, like need-to-know information.
* **Confidential** refers to assets whose disclosure may lead to a significant negative impact on an organization.
* **Internal-only** describes assets that are available to employees and business partners.
* **Public** is the lowest level of classification. These assets have no negative consequences to the organization if they're released.

## Assets in a Digital World

In today's connected world, information, often in digital form (data), is a highly valuable asset for organizations. Protecting this data is paramount, as weak information security can lead to significant issues like identity theft, financial loss, and reputational damage.The three states of data:

* **Data in Use:** This refers to data actively being accessed or processed by users, such as checking emails on a laptop.
* **Data in Transit:** This describes data that is moving from one location to another, like sending an email.
* **Data at Rest:** This is data that is stored and not currently being accessed, for example, data on a closed laptop or stored in the cloud.

### Cloud Security

So much of the global marketplace has shifted to cloud-based services. Cloud technology is still new, resulting in the emergence of new security models and a range of security challenges. And it's likely that other concerns might arise as more businesses become reliant on the cloud. Being familiar with the cloud and the different services that are available is an important step towards supporting any organizations efforts to protect information online.

In a traditional model, organizations had their entire IT infrastructure on premises. Protecting those systems was entirely up to the internal security team in that environment. These responsibilities are not so clearly defined when part or all of an operational environment is in the cloud. In cloud security, this concept is known as the shared responsibility model.

**Note:** The amount of responsibility that is delegated to a service provider varies depending on the service being used: SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.

Several challenges arise when data is stored in the cloud and accessed over the internet:

* **Misconfiguration** is one of the biggest concerns. Customers of cloud-based services are responsible for configuring their own security environment. Oftentimes, they use out-of-the-box configurations that fail to address their specific security objectives.
* **Cloud-native breaches** are more likely to occur due to misconfigured services.
* **Monitoring access** might be difficult depending on the client and level of service.
* **Meeting regulatory standards** is also a concern, particularly in industries that are required by law to follow specific requirements such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework

The NIST CSF is a voluntary framework that organizations may choose to use to assess and improve their security posture. Originally released in 2014, NIST developed the Cybersecurity Framework to protect critical infrastructure in the United States. NIST was selected to develop the CSF because they are an unbiased source of scientific data and practices. NIST eventually adapted the CSF to fit the needs of businesses in the public and private sector. Their goal was to make the framework more flexible, making it easier to adopt for small businesses or anyone else that might lack the resources to develop their own security plans.

The framework consists of three main components: the **core**, which outlines desired cybersecurity outcomes across six functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover, Govern); **tiers**, which measure the sophistication of a cybersecurity program on a scale of 1 to 4; and **profiles**, which are pre-made templates tailored to specific industries or organizations.

The **Govern** function was added to the core in February 2024 to emphasise the importance of leadership in managing cybersecurity risks.

In any scenario, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provides detailed guidance that any organization can use to implement the CSF. This is a quick overview and summary of their recommendations:

* **Create a current profile** of the security operations and outline the specific needs of your business.
* **Perform a risk assessment** to identify which of your current operations are meeting business and regulatory standards.
* **Analyze and prioritise existing gaps** in security operations that place the businesses assets at risk.
* **Implement a plan of action** to achieve your organization's goals and objectives.
