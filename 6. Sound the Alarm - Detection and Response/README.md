# Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response

## Overview

* Incident response lifecycle
* Monitor and analyse network traffic
* Processes and procedures
* Interpret logs and alerts

## Module 1: Introduction to detection and incident response

This module introduces detection and incident response and outlines the steps involved in the incident response process. It also explains how cybersecurity professionals verify and respond to malicious threats.

## Module 2: Protect organizational assets

This module covers the importance of network monitoring and how to understand network traffic. It then explains how to use network protocol analyser tools, commonly referred to as packet sniffers. Learners will sniff the network and analyze packets for malicious threats, and craft filtering commands to analyze the contents of captured packets.

## Module 3: Vulnerabilities in systems

This module explains the various processes and procedures in the stages of incident detection, investigation, analysis, and response. It then examines the details of suspicious file hashes using investigative tools. It also covers the importance of documentation, evidence collection, the triage process, and related topics.

## Module 4: Threats to asset security

This module explores logs and their role in IDS and SIEM tools. It explains how these systems support cybersecurity teams in monitoring systems and detecting malicious activity. It also introduces several IDS and SIEM products and includes practice using tools to perform queries.
