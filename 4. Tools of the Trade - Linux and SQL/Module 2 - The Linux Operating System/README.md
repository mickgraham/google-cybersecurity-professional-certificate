## The architecture of Linux

The components of the Linux architecture are the user, applications, shell, Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, kernel, and hardware. A request to complete a task starts with the user and then flows through applications, the shell, the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, the kernel, and the hardware.

* **User:** The person interacting with a computer.
* **Applications:** An application is a program that performs a specific task. There are many different applications on your computer. Some applications typically come pre-installed on your computer, such as calculators or calendars. Other applications might have to be installed, such as some web browsers or email clients. In Linux, you'll often use a package manager to install applications.
* **Shell:** The text based command-line interpreter.
* **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):** Component of the Linux OS that organises data. It specifies the location, or **files and directories**, where data is stored in the operating system.
* **Kernel:** The kernel is the component of the Linux OS that manages processes and memory. The kernel controls all major functions of the hardware, which can help get tasks expedited more efficiently.
* **Hardware:** The physical components of a computer, such as hard drives or CPUs. Hardware is categorised as either peripheral or internal.
  * **Peripheral devices:** Hardware components that are attached and controlled by the computer system that can be added or removed freely. Examples of peripheral devices include monitors, printers, the keyboard, and the mouse.
  * **Internal hardware:** The components required to run the computer. Internal hardware includes a main circuit board and all components attached to it. This main circuit board is also called the motherboard. Internal hardware includes the following; the Central Processing Unit (CPU), Random Access Memory (RAM), and the hard drive.

## Different distributions of Linux

### KALI LINUX

KALI LINUX is an open-source distribution of Linux that is widely used in the security industry. This is because KALI LINUX, which is Debian-based, is pre-installed with many useful tools for penetration testing and digital forensics, which are key activities in the security industry.

### Ubuntu

Ubuntu is an open-source, user-friendly distribution that is widely used in security and other industries. It has both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI). Ubuntu is also Debian-derived and includes common applications by default. Users can also download many more applications from a package manager, including security-focused tools. Because of its wide use, Ubuntu has an especially large number of community resources to support users. Ubuntu is also widely used for cloud computing. As organizations migrate to cloud servers, cybersecurity work may more regularly involve Ubuntu derivatives.

### Parrot

Parrot is an open-source distribution that is commonly used for security. Similar to KALI LINUX, Parrot comes with pre-installed tools related to penetration testing and digital forensics. Like both KALI LINUX and Ubuntu, it is based on Debian. Parrot is also considered to be a user-friendly Linux distribution. This is because it has a GUI that many find easy to navigate.

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux

Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a subscription-based distribution of Linux built for enterprise use. Red Hat is not free, which is a major difference from the previously mentioned distributions. Because it's built and supported for enterprise use, Red Hat also offers a dedicated support team for customers to call about issues.

### AlmaLinux

AlmaLinux is a community-driven Linux distribution that was created as a stable replacement for CentOS. CentOS was an open-source distribution that is closely related to Red Hat, and its final stable release, CentOS 8, was in December 2021. CentOS used source code published by Red Hat to provide a similar platform. AlmaLinux is designed to be a drop-in replacement for CentOS 8. This ensures that applications and configurations that worked on CentOS will continue to function on AlmaLinux.

## The shell

Shells are a fundamental part of the Linux operating system. Shells are command-line interpreters that allow you to give commands to the computer and receive responses from it. They can be thought of as a translator between you and your computer system.

There are many different types of shells:

* Bourne-Again Shell (bash)
* C Shell (csh)
* Korn Shell (ksh)
* Enhanced C shell (tcsh)
* Z Shell (zsh)

However, the bash shell is the most commonly used shell in the cybersecurity profession.

### Bash

Bash is the default shell in most Linux distributions. It's considered a user-friendly shell. You can use bash for basic Linux commands as well as larger projects.
