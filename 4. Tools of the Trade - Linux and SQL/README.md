# Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL

## Overview

This course aims to develop an understanding of the fundamentals of computing to support work as a security analyst. The course covers foundational concepts related to operating systems, interacting with the Linux operating system through commands, and querying databases using Structured Query Language (SQL).

### Module 1: Introduction to Operating Systems

This module explains the relationship between operating systems, hardware, and software, and outlines the primary functions of an operating system. It also identifies common operating systems in use today and describes how both graphical user interfaces (GUI) and command-line interfaces (CLI) enable user interaction with the operating system.

### Module 2: The Linux Operating System

This module introduces the Linux operating system and explains its common applications in cybersecurity. It covers Linux architecture, common Linux distributions, and the Linux shell, including how the shell is used to communicate with the operating system.

### Module 3: Linux Commands in the Bash Shell

This module introduces Linux commands as entered through the Bash shell. It covers using the Bash shell to navigate and manage the file system, as well as to authorize and authenticate users. It also identifies resources for obtaining help when working with new Linux commands.

### Module 4: Databases and SQL

This module provides practice using SQL to communicate with databases. It covers querying a database, filtering results, and using SQL to join multiple tables together in a query.
