# Portfolio Activity: Use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to respond to a security incident

*This cybersecurity incident report is based on a fictional scenario.*

## Overview

In this activity, you will create an incident report using the knowledge you've gained about networks throughout this course to analyze a network incident. You will analyze the situation using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). The CSF is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Creating a quality cybersecurity incident report and applying the CSF can demonstrate a proactive approach to security, improving communication and transparency with stakeholders, and improve security practices within your organization. You can also add the incident report you create to your cybersecurity portfolio when  you complete it.

The CSF is scalable and can be applied in a wide variety of contexts. As you continue to learn more and refine your understanding of key cybersecurity skills, you can use the templates provided in this activity in other situations. Knowing how to identify which security measures to apply in response to business needs will help you determine which are the best available options when it comes to network security.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. In the next course item, you will be able to self-assess your response. After that, there will be a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. It will also provide an opportunity for you to answer rubric questions that allow you to reflect on key elements of your professional statement.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access the incident report analysis template

* [Incident report analysis](incident-report-analysis.docx)

Link to supporting materials:

* [Applying the NIST CSF](applying-the-NIST-CSF.docx)
* [Example of an incident report analysis](incident-report-analysis-completed-example.docx)

### Step 2: Summarise the security event

Using the template provided, provide a summary of the security event that occurred. Include information about the security event, its cause, the impact, and the response. You can also include information about targeted systems, the attack source, and the estimated impact.

### Step 3: Identify the type of attack and the systems affected

Think about all of the concepts covered in the course so far and reflect on the scenario and define what type of attack occurred and which systems were affected.

### Step 4: Protect the assets in your organisation from being compromised

Next, you will assess where the organization can improve to further protect its assets. In this step, you will focus on creating an immediate action plan to respond to the cybersecurity incident. When creating this plan, reflect on the following question:

* What systems or procedures need to be updated or changed to further secure the organization's assets?

### Step 5: Detect similar incidents in the future

It is important to continuously monitor network traffic on network devices to check for suspicious activity, such as incoming external ICMP packets from non-trusted IP addresses attempting to pass through the organization's network firewall.

For this step, consider ways you and your team can monitor and analyze network traffic, software applications, track authorized versus unauthorised users, and detect any unusual activity on user accounts.

### Step 6: Respond to future cybersecurity incidents

After identifying the tools and methods you and your organization have in place for detecting potential vulnerabilities and threats, create a response plan in the event of a future incident. This typically happens after the incident occurred and has been resolved by you and your team. In this case, you will create a response plan for future cybersecurity incidents. Some items to consider when creating a response plan to any cybersecurity incident:

* How can you and your team contain cybersecurity incidents and affected devices?
* What procedures are in place to help you and your team neutralise cybersecurity incidents?
* What data or information can be used to analyze this incident?
* How can your organization's recovery process be improved to better handle future cybersecurity incidents?

### Step 7: Recover form the incident

Consider what steps need to be taken to help the organization recover from the cybersecurity incident. Reflect on all the information you gathered about the incident in the previous steps to consider which devices, systems, and processes need to be restored and recovered.

Consider the following questions:

* What information do you need to be able to recover immediately?
* What processes are in place to help the organization recover from the incident?
