## Analysis of Network Hardening

**Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement**

| Vulnerability             | Hardening Tool                            | How it Helps                                                                  |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Employees share passwords | **Password policies**                     | Enforces secure, unique passwords and eliminates use of default credentials   |
| Default admin password    | **Password policies**                     | Requires strong credentials for all accounts                                  |
| No firewall traffic rules | **Firewall maintenance + port filtering** | Creates rules to control inbound/outbound traffic and block unnecessary ports |
| MFA not used              | **Multifactor authentication (MFA)**      | Adds additional identity verification to prevent unauthorised access          |

**Part 2: Explain your recommendations**

* **Password policies:** will prevent employees from sharing passwords and will eliminate the use of default passwords.
  * Should be set up once and periodically reviewed.
* **Firewall maintenance and port filtering:** Together will protect against abnormal network traffic and limit unwanted communication.
  * Should be reviewed and updated at regular intervals.
* **Multifactor authentication (MFA)**: Will help to keep customers personal information hidden.
  * Should be set up once and then periodically reviewed.
