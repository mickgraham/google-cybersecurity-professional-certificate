# Portfolio Activity: Document an incident with an incident handlers journal

*This activity is based on a fictional scenario.*

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will review the details of a security incident and document the incident using your incident handler's journal. Previously, you learned about the importance of documentation in the incident response process. You've also learned how an incident handler's journal is used to record information about security incidents as they are handled.

## Part 1 - Open a report template

### Step 1: Access the template

* [incident handlers journal](incident-handlers-journal.docx)

### Step 2: Review the scenario

Review the details of the scenario. Consider the following key details:

* A small U.S. health care clinic experienced a security incident on Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. which severely disrupted their business operations.
* The cause of the security incident was a phishing email that contained a malicious attachment. Once it was downloaded, ransomware was deployed encrypting the organization's computer files.
* An organised group of unethical hackers left a ransom note stating that the company's files were encrypted and demanded money in exchange for the decryption key

# Step 3: Record a journal entry

Use the incident handler's journal to document your first journal entry about the given scenario. Ensure that you fill in all of the fields:

* In the **Date** section, record the date of your journal entry. This should be the actual date that you record the entry, not a fictional date.
* In the **Entry** section, provide a journal entry number. For example, if it is your first journal entry, enter 1.
* In the Description section, provide a description about the entry.
* In the **Tool(s) used** section, if any cybersecurity tools were used, list them here.
* In the **The 5 W's** section, record the details about the given scenario.
  * Who caused the incident?
  * What happened?
  * When did the incident occur?
  * Where did the incident happen?
  * Why did the incident happen?

In the **Additional notes** row, record any thoughts or questions you have about the given scenario.
