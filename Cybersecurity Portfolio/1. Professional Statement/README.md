# Professional Statement

I am a versatile Software Engineer with extensive experience in systems design, full-stack development, and collaborative technical leadership. I am expanding my capabilities into cybersecurity to strengthen my ability to design and deliver secure software systems.

My focus includes applying secure development practices throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and using frameworks such as OWASP and NIST to reduce vulnerabilities and support risk-based decision-making when developing software and implementing cybersecurity controls.

Cybersecurity appeals to me for the same reasons that drew me to software engineering, as it is an evolving field that requires analytical thinking, structured problem-solving, and continuous learning. As part of my development, I am looking to improve my skills in securing cloud environments across platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

This statement is currently intended for peers and participants in cybersecurity education programs. I aim to expand it to include cybersecurity professionals and recruiters seeking professionals with experience in software development and cybersecurity. My background in software engineering enables me to directly build robust, reliable, and secure applications.
