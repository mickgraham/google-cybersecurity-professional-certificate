# Module 4: Use Playbooks to Respond to Incidents

## Overview

* **Playbooks:** A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action
* **Six phases of incident response:**: An incident response is an organisation's quick attempt to identify an attack, aontain the damage, and correct the effects of a security breach

## Playbooks

A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action. Essentially, a playbook provides a predefined and up-to-date list of steps to perform when responding to an incident.

Playbooks are accompanied by a strategy. The strategy outlines expectations of team members who are assigned a task, and some playbooks also list the individuals responsible. The outlined expectations are accompanied by a plan. The plan dictates how the specific task outlined in the playbook must be completed.

Playbooks should be treated as living documents, which means that they are frequently updated by security team members to address industry changes and new threats. Playbooks are generally managed as a collaborative effort, since security team members have different levels of expertise.

Updates are often made if:

* A failure is identified, such as an oversight in the outlined policies and procedures, or in the playbook itself.
* There is a change in industry standards, such as changes in laws or regulatory compliance.
* The cybersecurity landscape changes due to evolving threat actor tactics and techniques.

Playbooks sometimes cover specific incidents and vulnerabilities. These might include ransomware, vishing, business email compromise (BEC), and other attacks previously discussed. Incident and vulnerability response playbooks are very common, but they are not the only types of playbooks organizations develop.

### Incident and vulnerability response playbooks

Incident and vulnerability response playbooks are commonly used by entry-level cybersecurity professionals. They are developed based on the goals outlined in an organization’s business continuity plan.

When an incident, threat, or vulnerability occurs or is identified, the level of risk to the organization depends on the potential damage to its assets. A basic formula for determining the level of risk is that risk equals the likelihood of a threat. For this reason, a sense of urgency is essential. Following the steps outlined in playbooks is also important if any forensic task is being carried out. Mishandling data can easily compromise forensic data, rendering it unusable.

## Six phases of incident response

Common steps included in using playbooks to respond to incidents include:

* **Preparation:** Before incidents occur, mitigate potential impacts on the organization by documenting, establishing staffing plans, and educating users.
* **Detection & Analysis:** Detect and analyze events by implementing defined processes and appropriate technology.
* **Containment:** Prevent further damage and reduce immediate impact of incidents.
* **Eradication & Recovery:** Completely remove artifacts of the incident so that an organization can return to normal operations.
* **Post-Incident Activity:** Document the incident, inform organizational leadership, and apply lessons learned.
* **Coordination:** Report incidents and share information throughout the response process, based on established standards.
