# Module 3: Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools

## Overview

* **Logs:** A record of events that occue within an organisations system and networks.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Dashboards:** Applications that collect and analyse log data to monitor critical activities in an organisation.
* **Common SIEM tools**:

## Logs

Three common log sources include firewall logs, network logs, and server logs.

* A **firewall log** is a record of attempted or established connections for incoming traffic from the internet. It also includes outbound requests to the internet from within the network.
* A **network log** is a record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network. It also records connections between devices and services on the network.
* A **server log** is a record of events related to services such as websites, emails, or file shares. It includes actions such as login, password, and username requests.

By monitoring logs security teams can identify vulnerabilities and potential data breaches. Understanding logs is important because SIEM tools rely on logs to monitor systems and detect security threats.

## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools

A **SIEM tool** is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. It provides real-time visibility, event monitoring and analysis, and automated alerts. It also stores all log data in a centralized location. SIEM tools must be configured and customized to meet each organization's unique security needs. SIEM tools can also be used to create dashboards.

**SIEM dashboards** help security analysts quickly and easily access their organization's security information as charts, graphs, or tables. In addition to providing a comprehensive summary of security-related data, SIEM dashboards also provide stakeholders with different metrics.

**Metrics** are key technical attributes such as response time, availability, and failure rate, which are used to assess the performance of a software application. SIEM dashboards can be customized to display specific metrics or other data that are relevant to different members in an organization.

For example, a security analyst may create a dashboard using a SIEM tool that displays metrics for monitoring everyday business operations, like the volume of incoming and outgoing network traffic. As new threats and vulnerabilities emerge, organizations must continually customize their SIEM tools to ensure that threats are detected and quickly addressed.

## SIEM Tools

**Self-hosted** SIEM tools require organizations to install, operate, and maintain the tool using their own physical infrastructure, such as server capacity. These applications are then managed and maintained by the organization's IT department, rather than a third party vendor. Self-hosted SIEM tools are ideal when an organization is required to maintain physical control over confidential data. Alternatively, **cloud-hosted** SIEM tools are maintained and managed by the SIEM providers, making them accessible through the internet. Cloud-hosted SIEM tools are ideal for organizations that don't want to invest in creating and maintaining their own infrastructure. An organization can choose to use a combination of both self-hosted and cloud-hosted SIEM tools, known as a **hybrid** solution.

Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud, and Chronicle are common SIEM tools that many organizations use to help protect their data and systems.

* **Splunk Enterprise:** A self-hosted tool used to retain, analyse, and search an organisations log data to provide security information and alerts in real time.
* **Splunk Could:** A cloud-hosted tool used to collect, search, and monitor log data.
* **Chronicle:** A cloud-native tool designed to retain, analyse, and search data.
* **Suricata:** An open-source network analysis and threat detection software developed by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF).
