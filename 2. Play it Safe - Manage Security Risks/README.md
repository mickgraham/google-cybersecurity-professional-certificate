### Module 1: Security domains

This module provides an overview of the CISSP's eight security domains and examines primary threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to business operations. It also covers the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework and the steps involved in risk management.

### Module 2: Security frameworks and controls

This module focuses on security frameworks and controls, along with the core components of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad. It includes coverage of Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) security principles and security audits.

### Module 3: Introduction to cybersecurity tools

This module explores industry-leading security information and event management (SIEM) tools used by security professionals to protect business operations. It describes how entry-level security analysts use SIEM dashboards as part of their daily work.

### Module 4: Use playbooks to respond to incidents

* Examples of frameworks commonly used in the cybersecurity industry include the National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework (
[NIST RMF](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf)) and Health Information Trust Alliance ([HITRUST](https://hitrustalliance.net/hitrust-framework)).
* the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) publishes a standard awareness document about the [Top 10 most critical security risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) to web applications, which is updated regularly.
* To learn more about the vulnerabilities explained in this section of the reading, as well as other vulnerabilities, explore the [NIST National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln) and [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).
